## Introduction
The Fish-Visual Trait Analysis (Fish-Vista) dataset is a large, annotated collection of 60K fish images spanning 1900 different species; it supports several challenging and biologically relevant tasks including species classification, trait identification, and trait segmentation. These images have been curated through a sophisticated data processing pipeline applied to a cumulative set of images obtained from various museum collections. Fish-Vista provides fine-grained labels of various visual traits present in each image. It also offers pixel-level annotations of 9 different traits for 2427 fish images, facilitating additional trait segmentation and localization tasks.

The Fish Vista dataset consists of museum fish images from Great Lakes Invasives Network (GLIN), iDigBio, and Morphbank databases. We acquired these images, along with associated metadata including the scientific species names, the taxonomical family the species belong to, and licensing information, from the Fish-AIR repository.
